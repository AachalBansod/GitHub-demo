Difference between async and defer: When we include a script with async attribute, it tells the browser to download script asynchronously while parsing HTML document. Once script is downloaded,it is executed asyncronously meaning it can run at any time,before HTML document is finished parsing.
When we include a script with defer attribute, it tells the browser to download script asynchronously while parsing HTML document. However,script is executed after HTML document has been parsed.
